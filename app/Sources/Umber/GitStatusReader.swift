//
//  GitStatusReader.swift
//  Finding the repository, and asking git what changed.
//
//  The spawning half of the git sidebar, split from `GitStatus.swift` so that the
//  grammar stays a total function over bytes with no process dependency. Both files are
//  `Foundation`-only and neither is `@MainActor`, so `Scripts/check-git-status.sh`
//  compiles **both** directly with `swiftc`: the parser is gated against real bytes, and
//  discovery is gated against real repositories, without linking AppKit or the app.
//
//  WHY DISCOVERY IS A SUBPROCESS AND NOT A `stat`. The obvious implementation —
//  "is there a `.git` directory at this path?" — is wrong on this very checkout. In a
//  git worktree `.git` is an ASCII **file** containing a `gitdir:` pointer, not a
//  directory, so `isDirectory(root + "/.git")` concludes "not a repository" for every
//  `.afk-worktrees/*` checkout including Umber's own development tree, while passing
//  every manual test anyone would run from an ordinary clone. Verified live here:
//  `test -d .git` is false and `head -c 100 .git` reads
//  `gitdir: .../.git/worktrees/afk-build-pr-17-feature`. Asking git removes the entire
//  class of bug, and it also handles the case the `stat` version gets wrong in the other
//  direction: a subdirectory deep inside a repo, where there is no `.git` at all.
