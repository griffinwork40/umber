//
//  FileTreeViewController.swift
//  The sidebar file tree, rooted at the Space's project directory.
//
//  Four concerns live in files of their own: the tree's model in `FileNode.swift`; the
//  `NSOutlineView` data source and delegate, plus the cell machinery they build, in
//  `FileTreeViewController+OutlineView.swift`; the right-click menu in
//  `FileTreeViewController+ContextMenu.swift`; and git status — the poller, the snapshot
//  and the branch header — in `FileTreeViewController+Git.swift`. What stays here is the
//  controller itself: the views it assembles, the identity-preserving `refresh()`,
//  `setRoot(_:)` (repoint the tree at a new directory — cwd-follow), and double-click
//  routing.
