//  Defaults.swift
//  The three `UserDefaults`-backed stores: font zoom, last Space root, open Space roots.
//
//  Its own file because these share one argument, stated once in `FontZoom` and
//  referred to by the other two: transient UI state belongs in `UserDefaults`,
//  **not** in the hand-edited `config.json` an app that rewrote it would strip the
//  user's comments out of. That makes them one concern, and a concern that is
//  independent of `AppConfig` — nothing here parses the config file or can fail a
//  launch. The `FileManager` extension travels with them because it exists solely
//  to serve `LastSpaceRoot` and `OpenSpaceRoots`' shared check-don't-trust rule.
//
//  `Scripts/check-space-restore.sh` compiles THIS file directly against a
//  throwaway harness to run its 12-case truth table, so the store it verifies is
//  the shipped one. Renaming or moving this file means updating that script.
//
//  No `import SwiftTerm` here on purpose: none of these stores touch the emulator,
//  which is what lets the check above compile without building SwiftTerm first.

/// would clobber them. `UserDefaults` is the idiomatic home for transient UI
/// state of exactly this kind.
///
/// `nil` means "no zoom — use the configured size", which is what ⌘0 restores.
/// It is app-wide rather than per-pane because the alternative is what v0.1
/// shipped: zooming in one tab left every other tab, every tab opened
/// afterwards, and every subsequent launch back at the configured size.
