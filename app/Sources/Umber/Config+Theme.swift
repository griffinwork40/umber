//
//  Config+Theme.swift
//  Turning a config file's `theme` block into a `Theme`, field by field, fail-soft.
//
//  Its own file because `Config.swift` hit the 350-line ceiling on 2026-08-03 and this is
//  its cleanest seam: everything here is one question — "given some optional strings a user
//  typed, which palette do we install?" — and answering it needs none of the rest of
//  `AppConfig` (no font resolution, no UserDefaults, no derived chrome). The rule for the
//  ceiling is to find the seam rather than shave comments, and the comments are the point:
//  every branch below encodes a decision about what a *wrong* config should do, which is
//  the part a reader cannot reconstruct from the code.
//
//  Takes primitives rather than the `ThemeSpec` it is called with, because `ConfigFile` is
//  `private` in `Config.swift` on purpose — the on-disk shape should not leak into the rest
//  of the module — and Swift's `private` stops at the file edge. Passing five optionals
//  keeps that boundary intact and has the side benefit of making this callable from
//  anywhere, including a future gate, without constructing a Decodable.
//
//  THE INVARIANT THIS FILE OWNS: it never throws and never returns a half-built palette.
//  One bad hex costs that one field and appends one warning; a wrong preset name costs the
//  preset and appends one warning. Six bad fields yield six warnings and a working
//  terminal. Preserve that — `AppConfig.load()` has no error path to fall back on.
//
