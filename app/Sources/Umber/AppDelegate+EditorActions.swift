//
//  AppDelegate+EditorActions.swift
//  Editor-specific menu actions: Go to Line, Word Wrap, Send Path to Terminal,
//  and Run in Terminal. Extracted from AppDelegate.swift when that file hit the
//  350-line ceiling — the seam is clean because every action here requires a
//  `FileViewerPane` to be the active document (terminals do not answer these).
//
//  Also holds the shared `shellQuoted(_:)` helper and `findAncestorFile(named:from:)`
//  used by the terminal-integration actions.
//
//  **Wave 3 actions**
//    · `selectNextOccurrence(_:)` — ⌘D, routes through the responder chain
//    · `showCommandPalette(_:)`   — ⌘⇧P, opens the floating command palette
//
