//
//  SyntaxPalette.swift
//  Which colour a syntax role gets, derived from the palette the terminal already has.
//
//  **Pure and view-free — Foundation only, on purpose**, like `ThemeValues.swift` and
//  `ThemeContrast.swift` beside it. This is the half of syntax highlighting that
//  `check-theme-contrast.sh` can compile standalone, and it is deliberately the half that
//  holds the *decisions*: which slot a role reads from, and what happens when that slot is
//  illegible. Painting the ranges needs AppKit and is therefore unreachable by any gate, so
//  everything a gate could hold to a number lives here instead of there.
//
//  NO APP CONSUMER YET, and that is the intended ordering rather than an oversight: the
//  colours become a measured claim before any code paints with them. The consumer is
//  `FileViewerPane+Highlighting.swift`, which does not exist yet; the gate
//  (`check-theme-contrast-harness.swift` §5k) is what exercises this file today. If that
//  file never lands, this one should be deleted rather than left as decoration.
//
//  Side effect worth naming: this is the FIRST caller of `ThemeContrast` inside
//  `Sources/Umber`. Until now that file was 204 lines of measurement compiled into the
//  shipping binary with every call site in the harness — recorded in AFK.md as an accepted
//  gap whose honest fix was "a runtime minimum-contrast clamp… which would give the maths a
//  caller inside the app". `commentColour` below is a narrow instance of exactly that, and
//  `SelectionPairing` (added alongside it) is the second.
//
//  Derivation, the exhaustive search and the rejected alternatives:
//  `.afk/research/editor-syntax-2026-08-03/`.

/// are absent for the same reason a terminal has 16 colours and not 256: each extra role has
/// to earn a slot that is measurably distinct from the four already there, and past this
/// point they stop being (see `SyntaxPalette` on the size of the distinguishable set).

/// Syntax colours as a **role mapping onto the ANSI ring**, not as new hex per palette.
///
/// **Why a mapping.** Three of the five shipped palettes are declared verbatim upstream
/// ports, and `ThemeValues.swift` states the contract they are held to: *"a preset's job is
/// to be the thing it claims to be — silently 'fixing' a port makes it a different theme
/// wearing the same name."* Inventing ten syntax colours for those ports would break precisely
/// that. A mapping invents nothing and inherits whatever legibility the palette was already
/// measured for. Note the limit, because the obvious next sentence is false today: this does
/// NOT yet work for hex a user typed. Overrides are applied to `Theme` (NSColor) by
/// `Config+Theme.swift` after `Theme.init(_:)` has run, and there is no `Theme`→`ThemePalette`
/// conversion, so `colour(_:in:)` below is reachable only from the five shipped presets.
/// Whoever writes the highlighter (#28) needs that bridge first, or the config's colours and
/// the editor's will disagree. It is also what the surrounding
/// ecosystem does: base16, every 16-colour vim
/// scheme, `bat --theme=ansi` and `delta` all express syntax as ANSI roles, so the editor
/// ends up agreeing with the tools running in the terminal beside it.
///
/// **Why these four slots.** All 360 assignments of the four chromatic roles to the six
/// chromatic ANSI indices were measured (`rank_mappings.py`). The optimum is a 24-way tie,
/// and every member of it uses the same slot set: **green, yellow, blue, cyan**. Red and
/// magenta are excluded by the numbers rather than by taste — under `afk-dark` both measure
/// APCA Lc 41.4, below the Lc 45 floor at which text stops being readable at any size. Two
/// consequences fell out and both are wanted: the four chromatic roles clear the floor in
/// every palette (the separate comment role has one pinned Classic Repaired gap), and **red
/// stays free**, which is the colour an editor will want for diagnostics and a diff for
/// deletion. Spending it on `number` would have been the expensive mistake.
///
/// **Which member of the tie.** Numbers could not choose, so convention did: `string` =
/// green is close to universal (base16 `0B`, `grep`'s match, a diff's addition), and
/// `keyword` = blue with `type` = cyan follows VS Code Dark+'s blue keywords and teal types.
/// Measured for umber: every role ≥ Lc 49.5, worst pair separation dE-OK 0.118, worst
/// dichromatic separation 0.119.
