//
//  DocumentTabStrip.swift
//  The in-window document tabs. Hand-rolled, on purpose.
//
//  Native macOS window tabs are KEPT by this design — they were promoted to mean
//  *Spaces* (projects), which is where drag-out-to-detach and Merge All Windows
//  actually mean something (plan §12.3, branch C). They cannot also serve
//  documents: a window tab is an NSWindow, so a mixed terminal/editor strip would
//  put each document in its own window and there could be no shared sidebar
//  (plan §12.2). Hence this strip — the one piece of chrome (C) pays to hand-roll.
//
//  Drawn in a single view with rect hit-testing rather than assembled from
//  per-tab NSButton/NSTextField subviews. Fewer moving parts, no subview
//  teardown churn on every title change (the shell repaints titles constantly via
//  OSC 0/2), and exact control of the one visual trick that makes a flat strip
//  read correctly: the active tab is painted in the *terminal's* background colour
//  so it merges with the content below it, while inactive tabs sit on a slightly
//  contrasted rail.

    // and another way for `mouseDown`.
    //
    // Strategy for more documents than fit: compress to a 56pt floor, then window
    // the strip and put the whole document list behind an overflow chevron.
    //   - Compress first because it is free and covers the common case: a
    //     1200pt window fits 20 tabs at the floor, so most people never see the
    //     chevron at all.
    //   - Window (rather than pan/scroll) because the window is *derived from
    //     `activeIndex`* and needs no stored scroll offset — one less piece of state
    //     to get stale against `reload`, and it makes ⌘1–9 / ⌘⇧[ ] scroll the strip
    //     for free: selecting a document always brings it into view.
    //   - Overflow *menu* rather than trackpad scrolling as the escape hatch,
    //     because a menu is the affordance that is guaranteed reachable — it is
    //     pinned to the right edge, keyboard- and VoiceOver-navigable, and lists
    //     every document including the ones the window is not showing. Trackpad
    //     scrolling would leave a mouse-only user with no visible way to reach a
    //     tab, which is the exact bug being fixed.
    //
    // Layout is strictly left-to-right and always ends at `bounds.maxX`:
    // [visible tabs][overflow chevron, if overflowing][+]. Nothing is ever placed
    // past the right edge, which is what the pre-fix `CGFloat(index) * tabWidth`
    // and `CGFloat(items.count) * tabWidth` both did once `tabWidth` hit its floor.

    /// A resolved layout for the current `bounds`, `items` and `activeIndex`.
    /// Purely derived — no stored scroll state to fall out of sync.
