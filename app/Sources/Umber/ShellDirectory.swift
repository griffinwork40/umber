//
//  ShellDirectory.swift
//  Asking a running shell where it is, and telling it to go somewhere else.
//
//  Pure and view-free on purpose — `Foundation` and `Darwin` only, no AppKit and no
//  SwiftTerm. That is not tidiness: it is what lets `Scripts/check-cwd-follow.sh`
//  compile this one file directly with `swiftc` and run a truth table over it, the
//  same trick `KeyBindings.swift` plays for `check-keybindings.sh`. In a repo with no
//  test target and no CI (AFK.md, "Checks"), a concern that cannot be compiled alone
//  cannot be gated alone, so the dependency-free boundary IS the testability.
//
//  Both directions of cwd-follow pass through here: `current(foregroundOf:...)` reads
//  where a shell is (driving `FileTreeViewController.setRoot(_:)`), and
//  `cdCommand(to:)` builds the line that moves it (written back through
//  `ShellHosting.send(text:)`). Keeping the read and the write together is deliberate
//  — they are inverse halves of one contract, and the symlink normalisation the read
//  applies is exactly what makes a write's echo compare equal and stop the loop.
//
//  OSC 7 AND THE KERNEL POLL. The kernel poll implemented here is now the FALLBACK.
//  `shell-integration.zsh` (Resources/) emits OSC 7 in its precmd hook; SwiftTerm
//  parses it and calls `TerminalPane.hostCurrentDirectoryUpdate`, which stores the
//  path in `_reportedDirectory` (`TerminalPane+ShellIntegration.swift`). When that
//  value is present, `ShellHosting.currentDirectory` answers from it directly — no
//  syscall, instant, exact. The kernel poll (`current(foregroundOf:fallbackPid:)`)
//  fires only when `_reportedDirectory` is nil: shells that have not sourced the
//  integration script, or between OSC 7 reports while a command is running.
//
//  The historical reason OSC 7 could not work (stock zsh gates the emitter on
//  `TERM_PROGRAM == Apple_Terminal`, which Umber does not set) is resolved by
//  shipping the integration script. The kernel path remains because it works on
//  any shell and requires no user action.
