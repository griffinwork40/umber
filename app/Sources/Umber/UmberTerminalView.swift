///
/// A subclass rather than a patch to `vendor/SwiftTerm`: the vendored copy
/// already carries one local patch (the Metal shader exclusion, see README), and
/// every additional one is future merge cost plus another step in the recreation
/// instructions. Key handling is this app's own opinion anyway, so it belongs
/// here — swapping back to the stock upstream package stays a one-line change in
/// `Package.swift`.
///
/// The hook is `performKeyEquivalent(with:)`, not `keyDown(with:)`. Two reasons,
/// in order of force:
///
/// 1. `keyDown` **cannot** be overridden from here — SwiftTerm declares it
///    `public`, not `open`, so overriding it outside its module is a compile
///    error ("overriding non-open instance method outside of its defining
///    module"). `performKeyEquivalent` is `NSView`'s own method, which SwiftTerm
///    does not touch, so it is open to us.
/// 2. It is also the right phase. AppKit offers a ⌘-modified key event to the key
///    window's view hierarchy *before* the main menu, so claiming these four
///    combos here is exactly how a view is supposed to take a ⌘ chord — and
///    returning false leaves every other ⌘ key (⌘C, ⌘T, ⌘+, …) to the menu,
///    untouched.

// MARK: - Private CoreGraphics API for font dilation
//
// `CGContextSetFontSmoothingStyle` is an undocumented CoreGraphics function used by
// Terminal.app, iTerm2, MacVim, and Emacs to control sub-pixel dilation on dark
// backgrounds. Declared here with `@_silgen_name` (the Swift ABI-stable way to bind
// a C symbol without a module header) rather than via a bridging header, which this
// SwiftPM package cannot use.
//
// Style values: 16 = thin, 32 = light, 48 = medium (Terminal.app default), 64 = heavy.
// Style 48 widens strokes approximately half a sub-pixel, which compensates for the
// anti-aliasing bleed direction on white-on-dark rendering that makes terminal text
// appear visually thinner than the same font on a light background.
//
// This function is PRIVATE API and may be removed by Apple without notice. Its
// presence on macOS 10.4+ through 26 is well-documented by open-source projects
// (iTerm2: PTYView.m:253, MacVim: MMBackend.m, Emacs: nsterm.m) but it is not in
// any public SDK header. The call is confined to `UmberTerminalView.draw(_:)` and
// guarded by the user's `fontThicken` preference, so it degrades to standard
// rendering if Apple removes the symbol (the linker would emit a missing-symbol error
// at build time, not a runtime trap — making the dependency visible immediately).
