//
//  Theme.swift
//  Hex colour parsing, and the AppKit half of a theme.
//
//  The palettes themselves are NOT here any more — they are pure data in
//  `ThemeValues.swift`, along with the name resolver, while the WCAG luminance
//  formula lives in `ThemeContrast.swift`. This file turns that data into live `NSColor` and
//  `SwiftTerm.Color`. The split is forced by verification: this file imports
//  AppKit *and* SwiftTerm, so `swiftc Sources/Umber/Theme.swift` alone exits 1 on
//  `no such module 'SwiftTerm'` and nothing in it has ever been gateable, while
//  `ThemeValues.swift` and `ThemeContrast.swift` are Foundation-only and BOTH
//  `check-theme-contrast.sh` and `check-light-theme.sh` compile them directly.
//  Same decision as `Renderer.swift` / `TerminalPane+Renderer.swift`: the pure
//  decision is checkable, the live action is not, so they live apart.
//
//  Its own file because this is the only *pure value* layer in the config path:
//  `NSColor.fromHex` and the presets have no UserDefaults, no filesystem and
//  no AppConfig behind them, so they are the one part of theming that can be read
//  and judged without holding the loader in context. `relativeLuminance` and
//  `asSwiftTermColor` live here rather than next to their callers because they are
//  colour-space conversions on `NSColor` with two consumers each, across files:
//  `TerminalPane.apply(config:)` installs the palette and logs bg luminance
//  (`TerminalPane.swift:86,111`), while `AppConfig.appearance` derives the window's
//  light/dark chrome from it (`Config+Chrome.swift`).
