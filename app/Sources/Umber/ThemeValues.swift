//  The shipped palettes, as hex strings, and nothing else.

//  **Pure and view-free — Foundation only, on purpose.** This is the half of theming
//  that `check-theme-contrast.sh` can compile standalone, which is the repo's only
//  mechanical gate (see `GitStatus.swift` and `Renderer.swift` for the same trick and
//  the same reason). `Theme.swift` imports AppKit *and* SwiftTerm, so a palette living
//  there is unreachable by any check — and a palette is exactly the kind of thing that
//  wants checking, because "is this legible" is a number and a number nobody computed
//  is a taste claim wearing a lab coat.
//
//  Why hex strings rather than parsed colours: different engines want the same palette in
//  different shapes — SwiftTerm takes a typed `SwiftTerm.Color`, others take a plain
//  `String` (see `NSColor.hexString`'s note in `Theme.swift`). Hex is the common ancestor
//  of both, it is what every upstream theme publishes, and it is what a gate can assert on
//  without linking a UI framework.
//
//  The OKLCH triple each colour was derived from is recorded in the comment beside it.
//  That is the actual design decision; the hex is a rendering of it. Full derivation,
//  the measurement tooling and the rejected alternatives are in
//  `.afk/research/theme-design-2026-08-03/`.
