/// The second `SpaceDocument` conformer — and deliberately the *cheap* one.
///
/// The file tree shipped before there was anywhere to open a file into, so
/// activating a row typed its path into the terminal and did nothing else: a
/// picker wired to a hole. This closes it with a plain `NSTextView` — editing,
/// undo, ⌘S, and regex-based syntax highlighting for the five roles
/// `SyntaxPalette` defines (keyword, string, number, type, comment). No
/// tree-sitter, no grammar bundles — a tokenizer that gets the easy 90% right
/// and stays auditable, which is the honest trade for a viewer.
///
/// **The hard part of editing here is not typing, it is the race.** This app's
/// premise is that an agent is rewriting these same files in the terminal next
/// door, so "the buffer and the disk disagree" is the normal case, not an edge
/// case. Two rules keep that from eating work, and they are the reason the code
/// below is longer than an editable text view has any right to be:
///
///  1. A dirty buffer is **never** auto-reloaded. `documentWindowDidBecomeKey`
///     re-reads only a clean one; on a dirty one it raises `hasExternalChange`
///     and leaves your text alone.
///  2. Saving over a file that moved under you **asks first**, and every close
///     path in the app funnels through `documentShouldClose()`.
///
/// The third rule is quieter: a *placeholder* body (binary, too large, unreadable)
/// is never editable. Without that, ⌘S on a clicked `.png` would write the string
/// "binary.png is a binary file." over the actual image.
