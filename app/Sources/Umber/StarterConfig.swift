/// The starter `config.json` template, as text.
///
/// Its own file because it is documentation that happens to be a string literal:
/// ~25 lines of user-facing prose (every `"// key"` is a comment the user reads in
/// their editor) with no behaviour, versioned alongside the fields it describes in
/// `Config.swift`. Sitting inside `AppDelegate` it made the delegate look 27 lines
/// bigger than the code it actually owns, and an edit to the template read as an
/// edit to app lifecycle in the diff.
///
/// Written only when `~/.config/umber/config.json` does not exist
/// (`AppDelegate.openConfigFile`); the app never rewrites an existing file. Keep
/// the values here in step with `AppConfig.defaults()` — that is the source of
/// truth, this is its annotated copy.
