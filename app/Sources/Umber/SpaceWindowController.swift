//
//  SpaceWindowController.swift
//  One window == one Space == one project root. Documents live inside it.
//
//  Native macOS window tabbing (tabbingIdentifier + addTabbedWindow) is KEPT and
//  re-pointed: a system tab is now a *Space*, not a shell. That is the whole
//  argument for branch (C) (plan §12.3) — ⌘⇧[ / ⌘⇧] cycling, the tab overview,
//  drag-to-reorder, drag-out-to-detach, Merge All Windows, full-screen behaviour
//  and VoiceOver all stay free, and they land at the level where detaching and
//  merging actually mean something: a project.
//
//  What a system tab could NOT do is documents. A window tab *is* an NSWindow, so
//  a mixed terminal/editor strip would give every document its own contentView and
//  there could be no shared, full-height sidebar (plan §12.2). Documents therefore
//  live in `SpaceViewController`'s hand-rolled strip. Two tab levels, each using
//  the mechanism that fits it.
