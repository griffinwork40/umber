//
//  GitStatus.swift
//  The porcelain-v2 grammar, and the value type the sidebar decorates from.
//
//  Pure and view-free on purpose — `Foundation` only, no AppKit, no SwiftTerm, and no
//  `Process`. That is not tidiness: it is what lets `Scripts/check-git-status.sh`
//  compile this one file directly with `swiftc` and run a truth table over it, the same
//  trick `ShellDirectory.swift` plays for `check-cwd-follow.sh` and `KeyBindings.swift`
//  for `check-keybindings.sh`. In a repo with no test target and no CI (AFK.md,
//  "Checks"), a concern that cannot be compiled alone cannot be gated alone, so the
//  dependency-free boundary IS the testability. The spawn lives next door in
//  `GitStatusReader.swift` precisely so this half stays a total function over bytes.
//
//  WHY SHELL OUT AT ALL, rather than a Swift git binding. Every candidate fails the
//  worktree bar this repo lives inside: SwiftGit2's newest tag is 0.6.0 (2019-04-15) and
//  no fork adds worktrees, SwiftGitX has no worktree API, and swift-libgit2 is a raw C
//  interop shim. Independently disqualifying: a C binding cannot be compiled by a
//  single-file `swiftc` harness, which would forfeit the only verification surface this
//  repo has. Measured cost of the subprocess is ~6.6ms on this checkout and ~92ms on a
//  60k-file repo, and it scales with tree size rather than dirty-file count
//  (`.afk/research/git-sidebar-external-mechanism-2026-07-31.md` §7).
//
//  WHY `-z` IS NOT OPTIONAL. Without it git applies C-octal quoting to any path with a
//  space or a non-ASCII byte, and whether it does so at all depends on the user's
//  `core.quotePath`. With `-z` the records are NUL-terminated and paths are emitted as
//  raw bytes unconditionally, so a filename containing a quote, a newline, or an emoji
//  arrives intact and config-independent. The cost is the one sharp edge this whole file
//  exists to get right: see `parse(porcelain:)` on the two-path rename record.
