//  FileViewerPane+IO.swift
//  The disk-reading concern: load a file, or explain why not.

//  Extracted from `FileViewerPane.swift` when that file approached the 350-line
//  ceiling. Everything here is "how bytes reach the screen" — `read()` decides
//  what to show, `reload(preservingScroll:)` puts it there. The write path is
//  `+Editing.swift`; neither needs the other's methods.
