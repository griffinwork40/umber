//
//  FileViewerPane+Editing.swift
//  Typing, saving, and the alerts that stand between a buffer and lost work.
//
//  Its own file because this is the *dangerous* half of the viewer. Reading a
//  file is fail-soft and reversible; writing one over an agent that rewrote it
//  underneath you is neither, and commit 1d1c3f2 closed a silent-overwrite path
//  right here. Isolating the write path — `write()`, the encoding-change prompt,
//  the overwrite prompt — means a reader auditing "can this destroy work?" reads
//  one file, and `FileViewerPane.swift` stays about getting bytes on screen.
//  `NSTextViewDelegate` rides along because its single callback exists only to
//  raise the dirty flag this file owns.
