//
//  CommandOutcome.swift
//  What a finished shell command should do to its tab — the decision, separated from the doing.
//
//  Its own file and Foundation-only, for the reason `Renderer.swift`, `TerminalEngine.swift`,
//  `KeyBindings.swift`, `CursorStyle.swift` and `ShellDirectory.swift` are: the interesting part
//  here is a *policy*, policy is a pure function of its inputs, and a pure function can be
//  compiled into a headless check (`check-command-outcome.sh`) while the AppKit half cannot.
//
//  WHY THIS IS NOT `DocumentStatus`. `DocumentStatus` lives in `SpaceDocument.swift`, which
//  declares protocol members typed `NSView` and therefore cannot be compiled without AppKit. A
//  mapping expressed directly in `DocumentStatus` would be untestable for that reason alone. So
//  this enum answers the *question* ("what does this outcome mean?") and the caller does the
//  one-line translation into the *presentation* type. That is the same split
//  `Renderer`/`TerminalPane+Renderer` uses, and the same reason `GitStatus.swift` must stay
//  AppKit-free while `GitStatus+Presentation.swift` holds the colours.

    /// — and marking those paints a status dot after literally every prompt, which trains the
    /// eye to ignore the dot and takes `.failed` down with it. Above it sits the case the marker
    /// exists for: a build, a test run, an install that finished while attention was elsewhere.
    ///
    /// It is a constant and NOT a config field on purpose. Umber's config is for decisions a user
