//  SpaceViewController+DirectoryFollow.swift
//  Keeping the sidebar pointed at wherever the focused shell actually is.
//
//  Its own file because it is one whole concern with a lifecycle of its own (a timer
//  that must start, stop, and not outlive its window), and because
//  `SpaceViewController.swift` is at 323 lines — inside `check-file-size.sh`'s warning
//  band already, with no room for a poller (AFK.md, "Conventions"). Only the single
//  stored property lives over there, because Swift extensions cannot add stored
//  properties; everything that property *does* is here.
//
//  WHY A POLLER AND NOT A CALLBACK. The poller is now the FALLBACK for shells that
//  have not sourced `shell-integration.zsh`. When OSC 7 IS emitted (i.e. the user
//  sources the script), `TerminalPane._reportedDirectory` is populated on every
//  precmd, and `ShellHosting.currentDirectory` returns it directly — the poller
//  still fires but `tick()` compares against `lastPushed` and early-returns without
//  touching the view (no-op cost: one comparison per 750ms). For shells without the
//  script, asking the kernel on a timer still needs no shell cooperation, works on
//  any shell, and cannot be broken by a user's dotfiles — the cost is a syscall pair
//  every 750ms while a window is key, and nothing when it is not. Full argument in
//  `ShellDirectory.swift`'s header.
//
//  DATA FLOWS ONE WAY, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE. The UI never moves the tree
//  itself. "cd Here" and every other navigate affordance write a `cd` to the shell
//  (`SpaceViewController+Delegates.swift`), and the tree moves only here, only after
//  the shell has actually moved. So the shell is the single source of truth, the UI
//  cannot disagree with it, and there is no second writer to race. The loop closes
//  rather than spinning because `FileTreeViewController.setRoot(_:)` early-returns on
//  an unchanged path and `ShellDirectory` normalises both sides to one spelling.
