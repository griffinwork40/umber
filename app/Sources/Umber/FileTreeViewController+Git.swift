//  Keeping the tree's git decorations current, and knowing what each row should say.
//
//  Its own file because it is one whole concern with a lifecycle of its own — a timer that
//  must start, stop and not outlive its window — and because the controller had no room:
//  the same argument, and the same shape, as `SpaceViewController+DirectoryFollow.swift`.
//  Only the single stored property lives over there, because Swift extensions cannot add
//  stored properties; everything that property *does* is here.
//
//  THE SNAPSHOT IS THE ONLY COPY, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. Nothing is cached on `FileNode`.
//  A row's decoration is looked up from the current snapshot at draw time, every time.
//  This deliberately departs from the research's Phase 1 sketch, which proposed a
//  `gitStatus` property on each node, and it departs for the reason the research itself
//  gives two sections later: all five of VS Code's separately-filed, separately-root-caused
//  stale-decoration bugs came from a clever incremental update scheme
//  (`.afk/research/git-sidebar-decision-2026-07-31.md` §5, Risk 2). A per-node copy is
//  exactly such a scheme — a second store that has to be invalidated in step with the
//  first — and the failure mode is silent, because a decoration that is merely *stale*
//  still renders. Consulting one snapshot cannot disagree with itself.
//
//  It is also cheaper and safer here. Cheaper: applying a snapshot costs nothing, where
//  pushing one into the tree costs a walk of every loaded node. Safer: `FileNode`'s header
//  states its contract — "a URL, two flags and a directory read" — and the research
//  rejected the synthetic-outline-group layout precisely for breaking it (§4). Adding a
//  mutable status field would have chipped at the same contract, and mutating nodes at all
//  risks the identity-preservation invariant that `refresh()` depends on. Nothing here
//  touches a node.
//
//  WHY A TIMER AND NOT FSEVENTS, for now. The research recommends FSEvents as the primary
//  signal with a slow poll as a backstop, which is what VS Code does, and that remains the
//  right end state. This first cut is the poll alone, deliberately: it matches what the
//  tree already does (`FileTreeViewController.refresh()` is driven by window-became-key and
//  says in its own comment that "FSEvents is the obvious upgrade if it ever feels behind"),
//  it matches the one poller this app already ships, and it is the half that needs no
//  CoreServices callback plumbing to be correct. The cost of being wrong is latency, not
//  wrongness. Upgrading means adding a watch on BOTH `GitRepository.gitDirectory` and
//  `.commonDirectory` — they differ in a worktree, and one alone is half-blind — plus the
//  worktree itself, since untracked files never touch `.git` at all.
//
