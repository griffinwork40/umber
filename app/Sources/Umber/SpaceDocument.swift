/// One document inside a Space — what a tab in the in-window strip points at.

/// This protocol is the entire point of the (C) restructure (plan §12.3). Terax's
/// tab strip is a flat *heterogeneous* union of eight kinds — terminal, editor,
/// preview, markdown, and four diff/history kinds — all in ONE strip
/// (`terax-ai/src/modules/tabs/lib/useTabs.ts:114-122`). Native macOS window tabs
/// cannot express that, because a window tab **is** an `NSWindow`: an editor tab
/// beside a terminal tab would be a second window with its own `contentView`,
/// hence no shared sidebar and no project-level grouping (plan §12.2). So
/// documents get a custom strip, and this protocol is the seam they plug into.
///
/// `TerminalPane` was the only conformer until `FileViewerPane` landed, and that
/// mattered more than it looked: a protocol with one implementor is a *description*
/// of that implementor, not a proven seam. Extracting the second one found three
/// places where the container had quietly stayed terminal-shaped —
/// `SpaceViewController.apply(config:)` fanned out over `terminalPanes` only, the
/// file-tree handler reached for `activeTerminalPane`, and `AppDelegate`'s zoom
/// anchored on `[TerminalPane]`. All three would have compiled and rendered fine
/// with a second document kind installed, and silently done nothing to it.
///
/// Hence the appearance and zoom members below are **hard requirements with no
/// default implementations**, deliberately. A default no-op would restore exactly
/// the failure mode just removed: a future editor/diff/Ghostty conformer that
/// forgets font zoom would compile, render, and ignore ⌘+ forever. Requiring them
