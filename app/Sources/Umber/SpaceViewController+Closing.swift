//
//  SpaceViewController+Closing.swift
//  Closing a whole Space: whether it may, and releasing what its documents hold when it does.
//
//  Its own file because `SpaceViewController.swift` reached 348 lines against a hard 350-line
//  ceiling (`Scripts/check-file-size.sh`) when `tearDownAllDocuments()` landed, and the rule for
//  that is to pull one whole concern out rather than shave comments. This is that concern:
//  Space-level lifecycle, as distinct from the per-document list operations that stay behind.
//
//  WHY `closeDocument(at:)` IS NOT HERE, since it is obviously the same subject. It mutates
//  `documents`, whose setter is deliberately `private` — file-scoped in Swift — so that every
//  write to the document list stays in one file (see the note on `documents` in
//  `SpaceViewController.swift`, which argues the one-writer discipline is the part worth
//  keeping). Moving it would mean widening that setter to `internal(set)` and trading a real
//  invariant for a formatting preference. Everything in THIS file only reads the list, or
//  delegates to a verb that owns the write — which is exactly why this is the half that could
//  move.
