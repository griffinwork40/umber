//
//  LiquidGlass.swift
//  macOS 26+ Liquid Glass adoption — the single place all glass-specific code lives.
//
//  Umber gets Liquid Glass *automatically* when linked against the macOS 26 SDK
//  (determined by the `sdk` field in the Mach-O LC_BUILD_VERSION load command,
//  set via -platform_version in make-app-bundle.sh — NOT from Info.plist):
//  the sidebar (via NSSplitViewItem) becomes a floating glass pane, window corners
//  round, controls gain glass bezels, and the menu bar goes transparent — all with
//  zero code changes beyond the plist keys.
//
//  This file handles the enhancements that require explicit API calls:
//
//  1. Window chrome adjustments (titlebar separator) so the glass reads cleanly.
//  2. NSGlassEffectView for floating panels (Command Palette, Symbol Outline),
//     replacing the older NSVisualEffectView(.hudWindow) material that predates
//     the glass system.
//
//  Everything here is guarded by @available(macOS 26, *). On macOS 14/15, these
//  helpers are never called, and the app renders exactly as it did before.
//
//  fullSizeContentView is deliberately NOT enabled here. It was tried (2026-08-20,
//  this file's first version) and caused the terminal's top rows to be clipped
//  behind the glass titlebar — the exact same bug documented at
//  SpaceWindowController.swift:132-141. The root cause: NSSplitViewController does
//  not propagate safeAreaInsets.top to a child view controller that uses manual
//  frame layout (DocumentAreaViewController.viewDidLayout), so the document area
//  extends behind the titlebar with no offset. Glass does NOT require
//  fullSizeContentView — the sidebar gets its floating glass pane automatically
//  via NSSplitViewItem, and the titlebar gets glass from the SDK linkage alone.
//
//  The terminal content area and the editor content area are NEVER touched by
//  glass — the ANSI colour contract, the 345-assertion contrast gate
//  (check-theme-contrast.sh), and SwiftTerm's opaque layer all require a known,
//  opaque background. Apple's own Terminal.app made the same call: glass chrome,
//  opaque content (MacForce review, September 2025).
