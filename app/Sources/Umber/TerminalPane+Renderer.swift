//
//  TerminalPane+Renderer.swift
//  Asking SwiftTerm for a drawing back end, and refusing to lie about which one it gave.
//
//  Its own file because `TerminalPane.swift` is 336 lines — 14 from `check-file-size.sh`'s
//  ceiling — and because this is one whole concern with a rule of its own: the *requested*
//  renderer and the *live* renderer are different facts, and every function here exists to
//  keep them from being confused. `Renderer.swift` owns the decision; this owns acting on
//  it.
//
//  WHY THIS IS MORE THAN ONE LINE. `setUseMetal(true)` can fail for reasons that are all
//  invisible from the call site: no Metal device, a shader source that is not in the bundle
//  (the state this project shipped in until 2026-07-31 — see patch 0001), a pipeline that
//  will not build. SwiftTerm handles this correctly, which is the good news:
//  `Mac/MacTerminalView.swift:379` is `throws` and the failure path leaves the view on Core
//  Text rather than trapping. But a `try?` on its own converts a real, diagnosable failure
//  into a terminal that is quietly slower than the config says it is — the exact silent
//  asymmetry `verify-vendor.sh` was written to kill, one layer up. So the request is made,
//  the result is read back from `isUsingMetalRenderer`, and any divergence is reported.
//
