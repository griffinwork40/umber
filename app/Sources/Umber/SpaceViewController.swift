//
//  SpaceViewController.swift
//  One Space: a project root, a sidebar, and N documents behind a tab strip.
//
//  This is the container the (C) restructure exists to create (plan §12.3). The
//  shape it implements, from Terax read directly (plan §12.1):
//
//      ┌──────────┬───────────────────────────────┐
//      │          │ ⟨ document tab strip ⟩         │
//      │ sidebar  ├───────────────────────────────┤
//      │ (tree)   │ active document               │
//      └──────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
//
//  Deliberate divergence from Terax: the strip spans the document area only, not
//  the full window width above the sidebar. That is VS Code's arrangement and it
//  reads better with a full-height sidebar — Terax puts its tab strip in a header
//  above everything (`terax-ai/src/app/App.tsx:1078-1220`).
