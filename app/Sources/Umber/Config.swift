//
//  Config.swift
//  The on-disk config shape (`ConfigFile`) and the resolved `AppConfig` type.
//
//  Config lives at ~/.config/umber/config.json. Every field is optional;
//  anything absent falls back to a default that is meant to already look good,
//  because the point of this app is that it is beautiful before you configure it.
//
//  Deliberately plain JSON rather than a bespoke format: it is diffable,
//  machine-editable, and needs no parser of its own.
//
//  This file owns: `ConfigFile` (the wire-format struct), `AppConfig` (the resolved
//  type with its stored properties, statics, `defaults()`, `resized(_:to:)`, and
//  `configURL`).
//
//  `load()`, `preferredMonoFont`, and `systemMonoAliases` live in `Config+Load.swift`
//  — extracted at the 350-LOC ceiling. `ConfigFile` is `internal` (not `private`) so
//  that extension file can decode the wire format; nothing else in the module reads it.
//

import AppKit
// No `import SwiftTerm`. It was here for exactly one symbol, `CursorStyle`, which is
// now this project's own type in CursorStyle.swift — see that file's header for why an
// app-wide config type must not name the emulator.

// MARK: - Config file shape

/// On-disk config. All fields optional — see `AppConfig.resolved`.
/// Internal (not `private`) so `Config+Load.swift` can decode it; nothing else in
