# shell-integration.zsh — Umber terminal shell integration for zsh.
#
# What this enables:
#   OSC 7  — tells Umber where the shell is on every prompt, so the sidebar
#            follows the shell without polling the kernel every 750ms.
#   OSC 133 A/C/D — command lifecycle boundaries, so Umber can mark a tab
#            when a command fails or a long-running build finishes while you
#            were looking elsewhere.
#
# How to install:
#   Add to ~/.zshrc (after oh-my-zsh / prezto / zi init if you use one):
#
#     [[ -n "$UMBER_INTEGRATION" ]] && source "$UMBER_INTEGRATION"
#
#   Umber sets UMBER_INTEGRATION to the path of this script in the shell
#   environment. If you prefer to source explicitly:
#
#     source /path/to/Umber.app/Contents/Resources/shell-integration.zsh
#
# Guard: only activates when TERM_PROGRAM is Umber. Sourcing in another
# terminal is a no-op, so this block is safe to leave in your .zshrc
# unconditionally.

# RFC 3986 percent-encode a path. Only the characters that are safe inside a
# file:// URL are left as-is; '/' is left unencoded (it is a path separator,
# not data). Encoding operates over UTF-8 BYTES, not Unicode code points —
# `printf '%02X'` of a multibyte character (e.g. 'é') yields the code-point
# value (0xE9), not the two UTF-8 bytes (0xC3 0xA9), producing a malformed URL
# that fails percent-decoding. The LC_ALL=C trick forces a byte-at-a-time walk
# so non-ASCII characters encode correctly: café → %C3%A9, 日 → %E6%97%A5.

# ── OSC 133 hooks ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# precmd fires AFTER a command, BEFORE the prompt is drawn.

# Both are emitted in a single precmd function registered with add-zsh-hook so
# the ordering is guaranteed — two separate hooks could interleave.

    # OSC 133 D — command finished. Only emit if a command actually ran (i.e.
    # preexec ran before this precmd). The _umber_cmd_running guard prevents a
    # spurious D on the very first prompt after sourcing, before any command.

    # OSC 7 — current working directory. Emitted here (in precmd) so Umber knows
    # where the shell is as soon as the prompt is visible. SwiftTerm accepts the

    # terminal can ignore OSC 7 from a remote shell in a local tab.

_umber_preexec() {

    # user's command, so Umber can measure how long it ran.
