# Why a script instead of an .xcodeproj: the project stays entirely text —
# diffable, reviewable, and editable by tooling — instead of a binary blob that
# churns on every touch. The tradeoff is that we hand-write Info.plist, which is
# a dozen lines and rarely changes.

# The SDK version embedded in the Mach-O LC_BUILD_VERSION load command is what
# macOS reads to decide whether to apply Liquid Glass and other modern visuals.
# SwiftPM sets both `minos` AND `sdk` to the deployment target (14.0), which puts
# the app in compatibility mode on macOS 26+ even though it was compiled against
# the current SDK. The fix: pass -platform_version to the linker with the real
# SDK version, keeping the deployment target (minos) at 14.0.
#
# Verified by otool -l: without this flag, sdk=14.0; with it, sdk=<actual>.
# Apple's Terminal.app shows minos=27.0 sdk=27.0; Umber needs minos=14.0 sdk=27.0
# because it still supports macOS 14 (Package.swift:11).

# The NS*UsageDescription keys are not paperwork — on macOS a TCC-gated request from
# a process with no matching key is DENIED, and for the folder classes it is denied
# silently, with no prompt and no entry in Privacy & Security for the user to grant
# afterwards. A terminal inherits every one of these requests from whatever the user
# runs inside it, so `cd ~/Documents && ls` in a shell hosted by a bundle without
# NSDocumentsFolderUsageDescription simply returns "Operation not permitted" and
# there is nowhere to go to fix it. (Microphone and AppleEvents are worse still: the
# request is met with SIGABRT rather than an error — that is what #23 fixed.)
# SDK metadata for provenance. The FUNCTIONAL mechanism for Liquid Glass is the

# Signing. The default "-" is an ad-hoc signature: enough for the app to launch on
# the machine that built it, and nothing more — a build downloaded from anywhere
# arrives quarantined and Gatekeeper refuses it until the user strips the attribute
# (see README.md). Set SIGN_IDENTITY to a Developer ID to produce a distribution build:
#
#   SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Griffin Long (TEAMID)" ./Scripts/make-app-bundle.sh release
#
# When a real identity is supplied the script enables the hardened runtime, signs every
# embedded bundle inside-out (Apple requires innermost first), and — when notarisation
# credentials are also present — submits, waits, and staples in one pass. The ad-hoc
# path is unchanged: no hardened runtime, no notarisation, works on the local machine.
