//
//  check-git-status-harness.swift
//  The assertion half of Scripts/check-git-status.sh.
//
//  Not part of the app: `Package.swift` globs `Sources/Umber` only, so nothing here is
//  ever linked into Umber. `check-git-status.sh` copies this file to `main.swift` in its
//  temp dir and compiles it against the two shipped sources under test.
//
//  WHY IT IS NOT A HEREDOC, unlike every other check script's harness. The shell half
//  plus this Swift came to 358 lines in one file, over `check-file-size.sh`'s 350-line
//  ceiling, and AFK.md's rule for that is explicit: find the seam and pull one whole
//  concern out — never shave comments, never raise LIMIT. The seam was already here and
//  is a clean one: the shell builds real repositories with real git, and this file makes
//  assertions about what the parser saw in them. Splitting on it also buys something a
//  heredoc cannot — this is real Swift that a formatter and an editor can both read,
//  where `<<'SWIFT'` swallows every syntax error silently until swiftc finally runs.
//
//  It must be COPIED to `main.swift` rather than compiled under its own name: Swift
//  allows top-level statements only in a file literally called main.swift, and this
//  harness is top-level code driving real subprocesses.
