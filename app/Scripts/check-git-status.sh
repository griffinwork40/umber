# check-git-status.sh — headless truth table for the git sidebar's data layer.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/GitStatus.swift` (the porcelain-v2 grammar) and
# `Sources/Umber/GitStatusReader.swift` (repo discovery + the spawn). Both are pure
# Foundation with no AppKit, no SwiftTerm and no @MainActor precisely so this script can
# compile them directly with swiftc, the same trick check-cwd-follow.sh plays on
# ShellDirectory.swift. Nothing here launches Umber, steals focus, or needs a window
# server.
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS TWO FILES. The shell half builds the fixtures; the assertions live in
# `Scripts/check-git-status-harness.swift`, which this script copies to `main.swift` and
# compiles. That is the only structural departure from the other check scripts, and it is
# forced rather than chosen: inline, the two halves were 358 lines, over the ceiling
# check-file-size.sh enforces. The harness file's own header argues the split.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The repo has no test target and no CI (AFK.md, "Checks"), so a
# feature's gate script IS its evidence. A status parser is the archetype of code that
# looks right and is wrong: the `-z` rename record silently occupies TWO NUL-delimited
# tokens, unmerged records have a different field count than ordinary ones, and
# `# branch.ab` is absent rather than zero on a branch with no upstream. None of those
# three is visible in a diff review, and all three are invisible in casual use — a repo
# with no renames, no conflicts and an upstream exercises none of them.
#
# FIXTURES ARE REAL. Every case below runs against a real `git init` with real commits,
# a real `git mv`, a real merge conflict from two genuinely diverging branches, a real
# bare remote, a real detached HEAD and a real `git worktree add`. Hand-typed porcelain
# strings were considered and refused: they encode only the author's assumptions about
# the format, which is exactly what a looks-right-is-wrong bug hides inside. Same rule
# as check-cwd-follow.sh:156-158 — executed, not string-matched.
#
# EXIT CODES, deliberately three-valued, copying check-reflow.sh: 0 = every case passed;
# 1 = a real assertion failed (the implementation is wrong); 2 = anything environmental
# — no swiftc, no git, a git too old for --porcelain=v2, a fixture that would not build,
# a harness that would not compile. A broken environment must never read as a green gate.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT TEST, stated so that "all green" is not misread as "fully verified".
# The gate covers discovery, the spawn and the grammar. It does NOT cover: the poller's
# cadence, the FSEvents coalescing window, badge glyph choice, colour legibility against
# the selection pill, or any of the AppKit wiring in GitStatus+Presentation.swift and
# FileTreeViewController+Git.swift — those import AppKit and cannot be compiled alone.
# They are daily-drive-verified only, the same category as `symbolName(for:)` today.
#
# ISOLATION. Everything happens under a mktemp -d removed by a trap: every repository,
# every remote and every worktree. No UserDefaults domain is touched, and no repository
# outside that directory is read or written — in particular this script never runs git
# against Umber's own checkout.
