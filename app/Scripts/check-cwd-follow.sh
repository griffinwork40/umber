# check-cwd-follow.sh — headless truth table for ShellDirectory, the unit both halves
# of cwd-follow run through.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/ShellDirectory.swift` only. It is pure and
# imports nothing but Foundation/Darwin precisely so this script can compile it
# directly with swiftc and never link AppKit, SwiftTerm, or the app — the same trick
# check-keybindings.sh plays on KeyBindings.swift. Nothing here launches Umber, steals
# focus, or needs a window server.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The repo has no test target and no CI (AFK.md, "Checks"), so a
# feature's gate script IS its evidence. cwd-follow reads another process's working
# directory through two syscalls and writes a shell command built by string quoting —
# both are the kind of code that looks right and is wrong, and neither is visible in a
# diff review.
#
# EXIT CODES, deliberately three-valued, copying check-reflow.sh: 0 = every case
# passed; 1 = a real assertion failed (the implementation is wrong); 2 = anything
# environmental — no swiftc, missing source, a harness that would not compile, openpty
# or posix_spawn unavailable. A broken environment must never read as a green gate.
#
# ISOLATION. Everything happens under a mktemp -d removed by a trap, including the
# directories the child shell is pointed at. Nothing outside that directory is written,
# and no UserDefaults domain is touched at all (unlike check-space-restore.sh, this unit
# has no persisted state).

// Swift marks fork() unavailable ("Please use threads or posix_spawn*()"). So
// tcgetpgrp(primary) fails here and these cases exercise the FALLBACK pid path. They are
// named for what they actually test. The tcgetpgrp branch is covered separately below,
