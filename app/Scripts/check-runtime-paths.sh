# Runtime verification of three paths that shipped without an execution record:
#
#   1. CWD — ⌘T opens a shell whose initial directory is the Space root, not $HOME.
#   2. CONTEXT MENU — "New Terminal Here" is wired to a live responder, not a dead selector.
#   3. BEL → ATTENTION — printf '\a' in a background pane raises .attention on that pane.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. Three behaviours were constructed and statically reviewed but never
# driven at runtime: the cwd fix was reading `root` at the right callsite, the context-menu
# wiring was reading `self` as target and `menuNewTerminal(_:)` as action, and the bell→status
# chain had delegate assignments that looked correct. Each is a short chain of two or three
# calls where a nil assignment, a mistyped selector, or an isActiveDocument guard-exit reads
# green in a code review and wrong at the keyboard. This gate drives all three.
#
# CASE 1 — CWD. `addTerminalDocument(start:workingDirectory:)` is called with `start: true`
# and a temp directory as the Space root. After the shell spawns, `ShellDirectory.shellCwd`
# reads the child's real cwd via `tcgetpgrp` + `proc_pidinfo`. That is exactly the same two
# syscalls the production `DirectoryFollow` poller uses, so a successful read here means the
# production follow path sees the right directory on its first tick. The check does NOT use
# OSC 7 — shell integration is opt-in and requires the user's shell config.
#
# CASE 2 — CONTEXT MENU. Verifies that the "New Terminal Here" menu item carries a non-nil
# target, the exact `menuNewTerminal(_:)` selector, and that the responder chain resolves it
# to a live object from the file-tree view. The full right-click path (NSMenuDelegate firing
# `menuNeedsUpdate`) also exercises the item-construction loop that sets `item.target = self`
# for every item with an action. Cannot reach: whether the menu appears at the cursor's
# position, whether it is keyboard-accessible, or whether the tap area is right — those need
# a real user event stream.
#
# CASE 3 — BEL → ATTENTION. Calls `view.feed(byteArray:)` with byte 0x07 (BEL) on a pane
# whose view has no superview, so `isActiveDocument` is false and the guard passes. Asserts
# `documentStatus == .attention`. Also asserts that feeding BEL to the ACTIVE pane (superview
# present) does NOT raise `.attention` — that is the guard's whole job and must be asserted
# separately from the positive case or a guard that always-passes reads green. Cannot reach:
# the NSSound.beep() side-effect (audio hardware), or the strip's repaint (visual output).
#
# EXIT CODES — the same three-valued contract as every other gate:
#   0 = all cases passed.
#   1 = a REAL failure — wrong cwd, selector mis-wired, status not raised, or guard bypassed.
#   2 = environmental — no swiftc, swift build failed, harness would not compile, or child
#       processes never appeared (the cwd case needs a real shell spawn).
#
# THE VERDICT IS THE EXIT CODE. The harness counts failures and exits on the count.
# A harness that died before printing any ok/FAIL line is treated as environmental (exit 2).
