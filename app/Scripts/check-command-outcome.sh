# Does a finished shell command mark its tab correctly? Asserts the OSC 133 status policy.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/CommandOutcome.swift` only. That file is Foundation-only BY
# DESIGN — the *decision* (what a finished command means for its tab) is a pure function of exit
# code, duration and whether the user is looking, and a pure function compiles headless with
# swiftc: no NSView, no window server, no shell, no `swift build`. Same trick
# check-renderer-config.sh plays on Renderer.swift, check-engine-config.sh on TerminalEngine.swift,
# check-cursor-style.sh on CursorStyle.swift, check-cwd-follow.sh on ShellDirectory.swift.
# Compiling the SHIPPED file, not a restatement of its table, is the whole point: a check that
# restates the policy proves only that the check agrees with itself.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. This policy is the kind that fails silently and in the annoying direction. Get it
# slightly wrong and a status dot appears after every `ls` — at which point the user stops seeing
# dots, and `.failed`, the one that matters, is lost with them. The failure has no crash, no
# warning and no visual glitch; it just quietly makes the feature worthless. `DocumentStatus` had
# `.running`/`.succeeded`/`.failed` sitting unwired for months precisely because nobody wanted to
# guess this policy, so the guess deserves an instrument.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT REACH, stated rather than implied. Whether the dot is legible, whether
# `documentDidBecomeActive()` really clears it, and whether libghostty's OSC 133 delegate fires
# when this policy assumes it does — all AppKit or live-shell territory. `check-ghostty-pane.sh`
# and daily use own those. This owns the mapping.
#
# EXIT CODES: 0 = all cases passed. 1 = a REAL failure (an outcome mapped wrongly, or the
# threshold moved). 2 = environmental (no toolchain, source file missing, harness would not
# compile). A broken environment must never read as a green gate.
