# End-to-end check: does a real ⌘⌫ keystroke actually arrive at the pty as ^U?
#
# `check-keybindings.sh` proves the MAP is right. This proves the WIRING is
# right — that `performKeyEquivalent` claims the chord, that the pane is the
# first responder, and that the bytes reach the program on the far side of the
# pty. It is the only check here that drives a real NSEvent through a real app.
#
# How: launch a throwaway instance of the bundle whose $SHELL is a stand-in that
# puts the pty in RAW mode and logs every byte it receives. Raw mode is the whole
# trick — in canonical mode the tty line discipline swallows ^U as VKILL before
# any reader can see it, so a correct terminal would look broken. Then post
# synthetic key events to THAT PID ONLY and diff the log against the expected
# bytes.
#
# Requirements and gotchas, both learned the hard way:
#
#   * Accessibility permission for the invoking terminal (System Settings →
#     Privacy & Security → Accessibility). Without it `CGEvent.postToPid` is a
#     silent no-op; the poster refuses up front rather than reporting a fake
#     failure.
#   * The app must be FRONTMOST while events are posted. AppKit only runs the
#     key-equivalent phase for the key window of the *active* application, so an
#     inactive instance falls through to SwiftTerm's old `keyDown` path and every
#     ⌘ chord reads as unfixed even when the build is correct. `open -n`
#     activates the new instance — don't click away while this runs.
#   * The script signals only the pid it launched itself, and only after
#     confirming that pid's environment names the throwaway shell. Matching
#     Umber by name and killing the newest/last match will eventually kill
#     the instance you are working in.
#
# Usage: ./Scripts/check-keys-e2e.sh   (opens and closes one window; steals focus)
