# Assert the Edit-menu actions this app does not implement actually exist.
#
# Undo, Redo and Find-and-Replace are the three menu items in `AppMenu.swift` with
# no Umber code behind them: each is an AppKit responder action reached with
# `target = nil`, so correctness lives entirely in assumptions about the SDK. That
# is a bad place for an assumption, because the failure mode is silent — a menu
# item wired to a selector nobody answers, or carrying a tag nobody recognises,
# renders normally, clicks normally, and does nothing. `AppMenu.swift` already
# warns about exactly this for the find items ("every item must carry a tag or it
# silently does nothing"); this script is that warning made mechanical.
#
# Three assumptions are checked:
#   * `undo:` / `redo:` are answered by **NSWindow** — not NSTextView, which does
#     not implement them. The window forwards to its `undoManager`, which is the
#     focused text view's, and that is the whole mechanism behind ⌘Z in the editor.
#   * the four find tags are the `NSFindPanelAction` raw values the menu reads off
#     the SDK, so a future SDK renumbering is caught rather than assumed away.
#   * tag 12 really does show the replace row. This one is *behavioural*, not a
#     value check, and it is the reason this script spins a real NSTextView:
#     `NSFindPanelAction` has no "show replace" case and stops at 10, so the item
#     uses `NSTextFinder.Action.showReplaceInterface` and relies on
#     `NSTextView.performFindPanelAction` forwarding the tag to its NSTextFinder.
#     Nothing in the value checks would notice if that forwarding stopped.
#
# The replace case is run in a SEPARATE PROCESS from the find case on purpose. A
# first attempt sent both tags to one text view and read 2 text fields either way —
# the bar kept the state the previous action left it in, so a completely dead tag
# would have passed. One process per tag is what makes the comparison mean anything.
#
# Needs a logged-in GUI session (it builds a real find bar), but the window is
# placed far offscreen, so unlike ./Scripts/check-keys-e2e.sh this steals no focus
# and needs no Accessibility permission. Exits 2 — not 1 — when no find bar can be
# built at all, so "no window server" is distinguishable from "the tag is dead".
#
# Usage: ./Scripts/check-find-menu.sh
