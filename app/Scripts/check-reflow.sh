# Assert buffer reflow does not mangle SCROLLBACK when the window is narrowed.
#
# This is the gate for SwiftTerm issue #494 and for the local fix
# patches/swiftterm/0002-index-iswrapped-buffer-absolute.patch, which changes
# Buffer.swift:1171 and :1211 from the screen-relative `_lines[_y].isWrapped` to
# the buffer-absolute `_lines[_y + _yBase].isWrapped`. Same technique as
# check-keybindings.sh and check-space-restore.sh: no test target exists, so
# compile a throwaway harness against the SHIPPED vendored SwiftTerm and run a
# truth table. The unit under test is the vendored emulator itself, which is why
# this script links .build/out/Products/Debug/SwiftTerm.o rather than any file
# from Sources/Umber.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS
# A previous gate (spike/Tests/SpikeGatesTests/ReflowGateTests.swift, deleted at
# 1e84dd0) claimed to cover #494 and was blind three separate ways. Each of its
# mistakes is inverted below, deliberately:
#
#   1. It never produced the state the defect needs. The buggy line sits in the
#      `else` of `if _y >= _scrollBottom` (Buffer.swift:1167, :1205), so it only
#      runs when the cursor is ABOVE the last row. Feeding "line\r\n" repeatedly
#      pins the cursor to the bottom row, where wrapping goes through
#      `scroll(true)` instead and the buggy line never executes at all. So its
#      `rows: 10, scrollback: 500` case could not express the bug even in
#      principle: `_yBase > 0` and the faulty branch were mutually exclusive
#      under that input. Verified — the old shape still passes UNPATCHED.
#      Every case here therefore seeds scrollback first, then uses absolute CUP
#      to put the cursor mid-screen before writing the wrapping line.
#   2. Its read-back was on-screen only: `terminal.getLine(row:)` returns nil for
#      `row >= rows` (Terminal.swift:759) and indexes `row + buffer.yDisp`
#      (:762), so it could never see the scrollback region where the corruption
#      lands. This uses `getBufferAsData(kind: .normal)` (Terminal.swift:5947),
#      whose loop is `for row in 0..<b.lines.count` (:5953) — the WHOLE buffer,
#      scrollback included. It is public; no @testable needed.
#   3. It asserted only that tokens were not DUPLICATED, never that they were not
#      MISSING. Both are asserted here, plus two stronger properties (below).
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY IT IS THE RIGHT PROPERTY
# Token counts alone are NOT sufficient: the observed corruption keeps every
# token exactly once and still wrecks history. Narrowing 80->40 with 20 seeded
# lines and the cursor CUP'd to row 5 produces, pre-patch, a blank row spliced
# into the middle of scrollback (row 5 becomes empty and every later line shifts
# down by one). So the load-bearing assertion is the INTERIOR HOLE check: no
# blank row may appear before the last non-blank row. The hole index equals the
# screen-relative `_y` the buggy flag wrote to, which is the defect's signature.
#
# On "missing tokens": a token vanishing is only unambiguous corruption when the
# reflowed content cannot have overflowed the scrollback cap. Grid search found
# 24 apparent "missing" hits that were all legitimate trimming (72 lines x 79
# cols reflowed to 10 cols is ~576 rows against a 500-line cap; the same input at
# scrollback 8000 loses nothing). That confound is what the old test cited as its
# excuse for dropping the assertion. The fix is not to drop it: every case here
# sizes scrollback with headroom, and the harness ASSERTS that headroom as a
# precondition (exit 2, environment) so a future edit that starves scrollback
# reports itself instead of masquerading as corruption.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/check-reflow.sh            # build if needed, run the truth table
#   ./Scripts/check-reflow.sh --quiet    # only the summary line and failures
#
# Exit codes (mirrors verify-vendor.sh / check-keys-e2e.sh: environment failure
# must never be confusable with an assertion failure):
#   0  every case passed
#   1  a real ASSERTION failure — reflow corrupted the buffer
#   2  ENVIRONMENT failure: vendor/ missing, no toolchain, harness would not
#      compile, or a case's own capacity precondition did not hold
