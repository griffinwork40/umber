# Assert that a `renderer` string in config.json maps to the renderer it names — and that an
# unrecognised one maps to NOTHING, so AppConfig.load() can warn and degrade.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/Renderer.swift` only. That file is Foundation-only BY
# DESIGN — its header says so — precisely so it can be compiled on its own with swiftc and
# never link AppKit, SwiftTerm, or the app. Same trick check-keybindings.sh plays on
# KeyBindings.swift and check-cwd-follow.sh plays on ShellDirectory.swift. Compiling the
# SHIPPED file, not a copy of it, is the whole point: a check that restates the table proves
# only that the check agrees with itself.
#
# WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM check-metal-renderer.sh. Different unit, different environment.
# That script needs `swift build`, the vendored SwiftTerm, a Metal device and a window
# server, and it exits 2 without them. This one needs swiftc and one 90-line source file.
# Folding the mapping into it would make the cheapest check in the pair unavailable on
# exactly the machines where the expensive one cannot run — and the mapping is also the half
# most likely to break, because it is hand-maintained spellings rather than a vendor API.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. Every behavioural case in check-metal-renderer.sh calls SwiftTerm's
# `setUseMetal` directly and therefore bypasses `Renderer.named` completely. So before this
# script, a typo in the mapping table would ship with that gate still green, and the symptom
# would be the quietest possible one: a config line that reads correctly, parses without a
# warning, and does nothing. That is the same class of silent failure patch 0001 caused for
# the life of the project.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/check-renderer-config.sh            # run all cases
#   ./Scripts/check-renderer-config.sh --quiet    # summary line and failures only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every documented spelling maps as promised and every unknown one is rejected
#   1  a real failure — the mapping, the round-trip, or the default is wrong
#   2  environmental — no swiftc, source file missing, or a harness that would not compile.
#      Never conflated with 1: a broken environment must not read as a green gate.
