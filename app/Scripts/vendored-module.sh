# One question, asked by the two gates whose subject is the VENDORED emulator rather than
# a file in Sources/Umber: **where is the compiled SwiftTerm module, and is it the tree on
# disk rather than something left over?**
#
# Sourced, never executed. `check-reflow.sh` and `check-altbuffer-resize.sh` both link a
# merged `SwiftTerm.o`, and both had an identical copy of this logic until 2026-08-05,
# when fixing it in one place and not the other became an obvious way to ship a gate that
# passes for the wrong reason. It lives here rather than inline because check-reflow.sh hit
# the 350-line ceiling, and the rule for that is to find the seam — this is the seam: it is
# one whole concern with exactly two callers, and neither of them is *about* build layout.
#
# Contract:
#   resolve_vendored_module   sets PRODUCTS to the directory holding SwiftTerm.o,
#                             or exits 2 (environmental — never an assertion failure).
#
# Callers must have already cd'd to app/ and may define say(); a fallback is provided so
# this file is testable on its own.

  # object at all, so on classic these gates cannot run.
  #
  # Two wrong versions preceded this one, and both are worth remembering. First a
  # hardcoded ".build/out/Products/Debug", i.e. the Swift Build layout treated as a
  # constant: it worked for the author (whose 6.4 defaults to that backend) and failed for
  # everyone else. Then `--show-bin-path` with no backend pinned, which is the supported
  # question asked of the WRONG backend — CI on 6.3.3 has the flag and still defaults to
  # classic, so it kept failing, just legibly. Selecting the backend is the fix. Asking
  # politely where the wrong backend put things is not.
