# Assert that the shipped `umber` palette is measurably legible — and that the rules
# doing the asserting are strict enough to reject a palette known to be bad.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/ThemeValues.swift`, `Sources/Umber/ThemeContrast.swift`
# and `Sources/Umber/SyntaxPalette.swift` only. All three are Foundation-only BY DESIGN — their
# headers say so — precisely so they can be
# compiled here with swiftc and never link AppKit, SwiftTerm, or the app. Same trick
# check-renderer-config.sh plays on Renderer.swift and check-cwd-follow.sh plays on
# ShellDirectory.swift. Compiling the SHIPPED files, not copies, is the whole point: a check
# that restates the palette proves only that the check agrees with itself.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Every claim a theme makes about itself — "legible", "colour-blind safe",
# "the bright colours are actually brighter" — is a number, and a number nobody computed is
# a taste claim wearing a lab coat. Measured with this code, the well-regarded palettes fail
# badly and silently: Solarized Dark's comment colour is APCA Lc 0.0 (invisible), Tokyo
# Night's and Nord's are 10.3, and Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Nord and Rosé Pine all ship
# *identical* values in their normal and bright chromatic slots, so bold text — which
# SwiftTerm draws from the bright half by default — is indistinguishable from plain. None of
# that is visible by reading hex. This gate is how Umber's palette avoids joining them.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT REACH. Everything that needs AppKit: whether `Theme.swift` actually hands
# these values to either engine, whether `installColors` took, the sidebar's git tints (which
# are macOS system colours by design and deliberately do NOT follow the theme —
# GitStatus+Presentation.swift argues why), and anything about how the palette LOOKS. The
# last one is real: four automated search passes each satisfied more constraints than the
# last while producing, in order, noise, pastels, neon, and a green that measured well and
# read as mint. The rendered previews in .afk/research/theme-design-2026-08-03/ are the
# record of that, and taste remains a human gate. This script guards the floor, not the bar.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/check-theme-contrast.sh            # run all cases
#   ./Scripts/check-theme-contrast.sh --quiet    # summary line and failures only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every palette parses, and `umber` meets every contrast, ring and colour-vision rule
#   1  a real failure — a threshold missed, a palette that will not parse, a preset that is
#      unreachable from config, or the falsification case PASSING (which would mean the
#      thresholds are too loose for any of the other results to mean anything)
#   2  environmental — no swiftc, a source file missing, or a harness that would not compile.
#      Never conflated with 1: a broken environment must not read as a green gate.

# CONSTANT-DRIFT GUARD. The harness measures the tab strip's derived colours from its own
# copies of three constants, and asserts the app's DEFAULT palette. If either file drifts,
# the harness keeps passing while testing numbers the app no longer draws — which is worse
# than having no harness, because it reads as a green gate.
#
# Comments are stripped before matching, for the same reason as the preset check above and
# with a sharper edge here: the rationale comment beside `textAlpha` names the OLD value
# (0.55) and the new one, so a naive grep would match prose and pass whatever the code said.

# This block was deleted by the #25 reconciliation merge (f8b6d38) and restored here. The

# match" while nothing checked it, and `AFK.md`'s falsification note still described a guard
# that was gone. Reachability moved into the harness legitimately; THIS is a separate concern
# that could not follow it, because `DocumentTabStrip+Drawing.swift` imports AppKit and can
# never be linked into a Foundation-only harness — a shell-side grep is the only instrument
# that reaches it (PR #24 review, finding 1).

# CONSUMER GUARD. A measured colour with no consumer is the failure this repo has already
# shipped once: `ThemePalette.selection` was designed, measured and asserted from the day the
# palettes landed, and for the whole time it reached NOTHING — `Theme` had no such field, so
# the value could not cross the AppKit bridge even in principle, and no check noticed because
# every check was about the number rather than about its reaching anything. Measuring a colour
# nobody draws is the same class of error as drawing a colour nobody measured.
#
# So: assert the wiring exists. Necessarily a grep — `Theme.swift` and the pane import AppKit
# and cannot be linked here — and therefore weak: it proves the expression is present, not
# that a selected range renders in it. That remains daily-drive territory. Comments stripped
# first and matched on the CONSTRUCT for the reason the preset check below documents at length.
