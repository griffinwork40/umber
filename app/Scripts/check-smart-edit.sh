# check-smart-edit.sh — the re-entrancy guard pattern, statically.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `FileViewerPane+SmartEditing.swift` uses a boolean flag
# (`isHandlingSmartEdit`) to guard against AppKit re-entering the delegate method
# `textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementString:)` during smart-edit transforms
# (tab→spaces, auto-indent, auto-pair, delete-pair). The correctness invariant is:
# every `isHandlingSmartEdit = true` assignment must be immediately followed by
# `defer { isHandlingSmartEdit = false }`, so the flag is always cleared on any
# exit path — including early `return false` — rather than relying on a trailing
# inline assignment that a future edit might accidentally skip or reorder.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT CHECK, stated rather than implied. Whether the flag actually
# prevents infinite recursion at runtime, whether the four guarded blocks are all
# the sites that need guarding, or whether the delegate method is called at all.
# Those are live-AppKit territory: `textView(_:shouldChangeTextIn:replacementString:)`
# calls `insertText(_:replacementRange:)` which re-enters via the delegate, a
# path that requires a real `NSTextView` and a window server. A static analysis
# gate owns the structural invariant; daily use owns the dynamic behaviour.
#
# WHY STATIC ANALYSIS, NOT A COMPILED HARNESS. `FileViewerPane+SmartEditing.swift`
# imports AppKit and references `NSTextView`, `NSRange`, and the rest of the pane's
# stored properties — it cannot be compiled standalone the way Foundation-only files
# like `CommandOutcome.swift` or `TerminalEngine.swift` can. An offscreen harness
# like `check-sidebar-toggle.sh` would work but requires `swift build` (30-60s) and
# linking all of Umber's objects, which is disproportionate for a two-line structural
# invariant that grep can verify in under a second. The check uses awk to enforce
# line adjacency: `defer { isHandlingSmartEdit = false }` must appear on the line
# IMMEDIATELY following `isHandlingSmartEdit = true`, with no intervening lines.
#
# EXIT CODES: 0 = invariant holds at all four sites. 1 = at least one `= true`
# assignment is missing its adjacent `defer` — a real structural regression.
# 2 = environmental: no swiftc on PATH (sanity check that the toolchain is present),
# or the source file is missing. A broken environment must never read as a green gate.
#
# Usage: ./Scripts/check-smart-edit.sh

# The adjacency requirement is load-bearing: the defer must appear before any work that
# could return early, so it must be the very next statement after the flag is set.
