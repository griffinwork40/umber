# Assert the Metal GPU renderer is actually REACHABLE — statically (the shader ships) and
# behaviourally (asking for it succeeds).
#
# This is the gate for patches/swiftterm/0001-ship-metal-shader-as-copy-resource.patch and
# for Renderer.swift / TerminalPane+Renderer.swift.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Until 2026-07-31 patch 0001 used `exclude:` on Apple/Metal/Shaders.metal,
# which kept the file out of the resource bundle. MetalTerminalRenderer.makeLibrary
# (MetalTerminalRenderer.swift:2746) needs it there so it can compile the shader at RUNTIME
# (:2765) when no .metallib exists; without it, it throws shaderSourceMissing (:2762) and
# the view stays on Core Text. So the vendored GPU renderer was unreachable for the life of
# the project — and nothing said so, because everything still compiled and ran. That is the
# same silent asymmetry verify-vendor.sh exists to kill, and this is its equivalent one
# layer up: a config that says `"renderer": "metal"` while the app quietly draws with Core
# Text is worse than a config that fails, because it is indistinguishable from success.
#
# WHAT MAKES THIS GATE WORTH BELIEVING. A check that only ever asserts "metal works" would
# still pass if it were asserting something vacuous. Three cases guard against that, and
# case 3 is the load-bearing one:
#
#   1. request metal -> the view reports metal            (the thing we want)
#   2. request coretext -> the view reports coretext      (control: the assertion CAN fail,
#                                                          so case 1 is not a tautology)
#   3. HIDE the shader, request metal -> the view reports coretext AND setUseMetal throws
#                                                         (falsification: proves case 1
#                                                          passes BECAUSE of the shipped
#                                                          shader, not for some other
#                                                          reason — this is the exact
#                                                          pre-2026-07-31 state, recreated
#                                                          on purpose)
#
# Case 3 is what the retired ReflowGateTests never had, and what check-altbuffer-resize.sh
# added as its control. Without it, this script could pass on a machine where Metal happens
# to work via a stale default library and we would learn nothing about our own packaging.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/check-metal-renderer.sh            # build if needed, run all cases
#   ./Scripts/check-metal-renderer.sh --quiet    # summary line and failures only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the GPU renderer ships and is reachable
#   1  a real failure — the shader is missing from a bundle, or asking for Metal silently
#      falls back, or the falsification case did NOT fall back (the gate is blind)
#   2  environmental — no toolchain, no Metal device, no window server, build failed.
#      Never conflated with 1: a broken environment must not read as a green gate.
