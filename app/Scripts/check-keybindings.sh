# Assert the mac line-editing key map sends the bytes it claims to.
#
# This app has no test target, and the thing being checked is a pure function of
# (virtual key code, modifier flags) — so instead of standing up XCTest, compile
# the SHIPPED Sources/MacTerminal/KeyBindings.swift together with a throwaway
# harness and run the truth table. Nothing is stubbed or restated: a change to
# the real mapping shows up here immediately.
#
# The negative cases matter as much as the positive ones. ⌥⌫ must stay
# un-translated (SwiftTerm sends ESC+DEL, which is delete-word-backward), and ⌘←
# has to be caught even though a real arrow event also carries .function and
# .numericPad.
#
# Usage: ./Scripts/check-keybindings.sh
