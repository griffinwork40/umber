#
# The document lifecycle, end to end: is a pane BUILT from the engine the config names, and is it
# FREED when its tab closes? Asserts `config.engine` reaching `addTerminalDocument`, then
# `documentWillClose()` for BOTH engines — a Ghostty pane's surface freed, and each engine's shell dead.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. `documentWillClose()` is the commit-point half of the `SpaceDocument`
# seam (`documentShouldClose()` asks, this one commits), and it was added because closing a tab
# leaked a libghostty surface AND the shell it spawned. Nothing else in this repo can see that
# failure: a leaked surface renders nothing, prints nothing, and fails no other check — the
# symptom is a Mac that gets slower over a day of opening and closing tabs. `AFK.md` carried it
# as a written risk for exactly one commit, which is the longest a risk should live as prose.
#
# WHY IT NEEDS A WINDOW SERVER. There is no headless path to a ghostty surface. `AppTerminalView`
# sets `core.isAttached = { self?.window != nil }` (`Platform/AppKit/AppTerminalView.swift:73`)
# and `rebuildIfReady` bails with "view detached" when that is false, so a bare `NSView()` never
# gets a surface — verified by execution, not inferred. Same offscreen accessory `NSWindow` shape
# as `check-ghostty-pane.sh`, for the same reason.
#
# EXIT CODES, same contract as its siblings: 0 = all cases passed. 1 = a REAL failure — a surface
# survived teardown, a shell survived it, or a doubled call misbehaved. 2 = environmental — no
# toolchain, `swift build` failed, the harness would not compile, or no surface could be created
# at all. A broken environment must never read as a green gate, and a crashed harness is telling
# you about the machine rather than about the code.
#
# THE VERDICT IS THE EXIT CODE. `check-ghostty-pane.sh` once exited 0 unconditionally with its
# verdict travelling only as a stdout substring, so a crash *after* printing "ALL-OK" read as
# green. This counts failures and exits on the count.
