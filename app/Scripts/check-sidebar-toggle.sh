#
# Is the titlebar sidebar-toggle button actually wired to something, or does it just render?
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `SidebarToggleAccessory.swift` installs one borderless NSButton on the
# leading edge of every Space window's titlebar, with `target = nil` and
# `action = #selector(NSSplitViewController.toggleSidebar(_:))` (`SidebarToggleAccessory.swift:82-83`).
# That is the same responder-chain trick the Edit menu already uses for Undo/Redo/Find — and
# AFK.md names the hazard class in plain words: "an item wired to an unanswered selector or an
# unrecognised tag renders, clicks, and silently does nothing." A titlebar button is one level
# LESS visible than a menu item: a menu at least opens and shows its whole list of items every
# time, so a dead one is a couple of clicks from being noticed. This button just sits there,
# looking identical whether the responder chain resolves or not. Nothing else in this repo
# would notice if it stopped working — that is what this gate is for.
#
# FIVE CASES, in order of "how far wrong could this be" — all five were proven against a real
# build before this script existed, in an ad hoc harness kept at
# ~/.afk/workspace/reports/umber-pr33-probe/harness1_main.swift; this script is that harness
# made permanent and folded into the check-*.sh contract:
#   1. INSTALLED — exactly one SidebarToggleAccessory really lands in
#      `window.titlebarAccessoryViewControllers`, on `.left` (rawValue 1) — the only positions
#      AppKit documents as valid are `.left`/`.right`/`.bottom` (`SidebarToggleAccessory.swift:41-46`).
#   2. SHAPE — the NSButton inside it has `target == nil`, the exact `toggleSidebar:` selector,
#      a non-empty accessibility label, a non-empty tooltip, and a non-nil image. The label and
#      tooltip are not decoration: a glyph-only control with neither is unusable by VoiceOver and
#      unreadable on hover, so this gate treats them as behaviour, per
#      `SidebarToggleAccessory.swift:84-90`.
#   3. RESOLVES — `NSApp.target(forAction:to:from:)` actually finds a responder for
#      `toggleSidebar:` starting from this exact button. This is the case that would have caught
#      a typo'd selector or a responder chain that never reaches `NSSplitViewController`.
#   4. TOGGLES — sending the button's own action twice, through `NSApp.sendAction`, flips
#      `isCollapsed` and flips it back. Not a proxy for a click: `NSApp.sendAction` is the actual
#      mechanism AppKit uses when the button is clicked, never a stand-in for it.
#   5. CONTROL, mandatory — the identical resolution call for a selector nobody implements
#      (`umberProbeNoSuchAction:`) must come back nil. Without this, cases 1-4 could be passing
#      because `NSApp.target(forAction:)` resolves everything it is ever asked about on this
#      machine, and the gate would be measuring the test rig instead of the button.
#
# WHY IT NEEDS A WINDOW SERVER. Case 3 asks the responder chain a real question and case 4 drives
# a real, animated split-view collapse — neither has a headless equivalent. Same offscreen
# accessory-window shape as `check-pane-teardown.sh` and `check-find-menu.sh`, for the same
# reason: a screen-negative frame is real enough for AppKit to answer honestly.
# `app.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)`, and NEVER `NSApp.activate(...)`: this process must not
# steal the user's focus or show a Dock icon while it opens a real, key-eligible window to probe
# it. (Measured: under `.accessory` with no `activate`, `window.isKeyWindow` reads `false` even
# after `makeKey()` — and case 3 still passes, because responder-chain resolution walks up from
# the `from:` view, not from key-window status.)
#
# EXIT CODES, the same three-valued contract as every other gate in this repo: 0 = all five
# cases passed. 1 = a REAL failure — the accessory is missing, the selector does not resolve, the
# sidebar did not actually toggle, or (this is the one that matters most) the control case
# resolved when it should not have. 2 = environmental — no swiftc, `swift build` failed, the
# harness would not compile, or the testable objects it needs to link are not there. A broken
# environment must never read as a green gate.
#
# THE VERDICT IS THE EXIT CODE, never a stdout substring. AFK.md records that
# `check-ghostty-pane.sh` once exited 0 unconditionally with its verdict travelling only as text,
# so a crash *after* printing "ALL-OK" still read as green. This script counts failures and
# exits on the count, and reclassifies a status-2/no-marker run as environmental before it ever
# reaches a plain `exit 1`/`exit 0`.
#
# LINK INPUTS. This harness never touches a `GhosttyTerminal` type — it never calls `.start()`
# on any pane — but it still links against `GhosttyTerminal.o`/`GhosttyKit.o`/`libghostty.a`
# because Umber's OWN object files (`GhosttyPane.o`, `GhosttyTerminalView.o`, pulled in by the
# `$OBJS` glob below) reference those symbols unconditionally. Measured, not assumed: dropping
# them produces `symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64` against `TerminalSurfaceOptions`,
# `TerminalSurfacePwdDelegate` and friends, so they go back in — same full object set
# `check-pane-teardown.sh` links, for a reason that has nothing to do with what this gate
# actually exercises.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, stated so "all green" is not misread as "fully verified": whether the
# button is visually where a user expects it (beside the traffic lights, not overlapping them),
# whether its glyph re-tints correctly across every shipped theme, how it looks merged into the
# native tab bar once a Space is dragged into a tab group, or its mirrored position and
# behaviour under a right-to-left layout. Those are daily-drive and visual-review territory —
# the same category `check-theme-contrast.sh` puts "taste" in.
