# Assert that the URL scheme allow-list in LinkScheme.swift matches the safety contract —
# that every allowed scheme is recognised as safe and every blocked one is rejected.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/LinkScheme.swift` only. Foundation-only by design — its
# header says so — so it compiles standalone with swiftc and never links AppKit, SwiftTerm or
# libghostty. Same trick check-renderer-config.sh plays on Renderer.swift, check-cursor-style.sh
# on CursorStyle.swift, check-keybindings.sh on KeyBindings.swift. Compiling the SHIPPED file,
# not a copy of it, is the whole point: a check that restates the allow-list proves only that
# the check agrees with itself.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. SwiftTerm's plain-text detector (`ghosttyImplicitLinkRegex`,
# `Terminal.swift:6204`) matches many schemes from raw terminal output — https?://, mailto:,
# ftp://, file:, ssh:, git://, tel:, magnet:, ipfs://, gemini://, gopher://, news:, and more.
# OSC 8 payloads are arbitrary. `openSafeURL`'s scheme allow-list is therefore the PRIMARY
# defence for every detected link — plain-text and OSC 8 alike. An incorrect entry in
# `LinkScheme.allowed`, or a bug in `isSafe`, could open arbitrary URL handlers on behalf of
# any program that prints to a pty. This gate makes that predicate auditable standalone,
# without a window server, a running emulator, or `swift build`.
#
# THE HARNESS DOES NOT RESTATE THE ALLOW-LIST. The truth table exercises the SHIPPED
# `LinkScheme.allowed` set via `LinkScheme.isSafe`; it does not hard-code {"https","http",
# "file"} in the shell. A harness that restates the table proves only that the harness
# agrees with itself, not that the allow-list is correct.
#
# Validated by falsification: adding "mailto" to `LinkScheme.allowed` makes case 7 fail;
# removing "https" makes case 1 fail; mistyping `s.lowercased()` as `s` in `isSafe` makes
# case 3 fail.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/check-links.sh            # run all cases
#   ./Scripts/check-links.sh --quiet    # summary line and failures only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every safe scheme is accepted, every blocked scheme is rejected, case insensitivity works
#   1  a real failure — the allow-list or isSafe predicate is wrong
#   2  environmental — no swiftc, source file missing, or a harness that would not compile.
#      Never conflated with 1: a broken environment must not read as a green gate.
