# Materialise vendor/SwiftTerm from nothing: clone the pinned upstream, apply the
# six local patches, and hand off to verify-vendor.sh for the verdict.
#
# Why this script exists: vendor/ is gitignored (.gitignore:20) but
# app/Package.swift declares `.package(path: "../vendor/SwiftTerm")`, so a fresh
# `git clone` of this repo CANNOT BUILD AT ALL — SwiftPM fails on a missing local
# path dependency before compiling a line. Until this script existed, the only
# recovery was a six-step recipe buried in app/README.md that grew a step every
# time a patch landed. That is a bad first impression and a real barrier to
# anyone who is not the author.
#
# Why it is separate from verify-vendor.sh: that script is a pure, offline,
# read-only assertion — it is called on every `make-app-bundle.sh` run and must
# stay cheap and side-effect-free. This one reaches the network and writes to the
# tree. Folding them together would mean a routine build could silently re-clone
# a dependency, which is exactly the kind of surprise the pin exists to prevent.
# So: verify-vendor.sh decides, bootstrap-vendor.sh acts, and the acting one ends
# by asking the deciding one whether it succeeded.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/bootstrap-vendor.sh            # clone + patch + verify
#   ./Scripts/bootstrap-vendor.sh --force    # discard an existing vendor/ first
#
# Exit codes mirror verify-vendor.sh, because this script's last act is to
# delegate to it and propagate:
#   0  vendor/SwiftTerm is present and matches the pin (freshly built, or already
#      good and left alone)
#   1  prerequisites missing, clone failed, a patch did not apply, or the tree is
#      in a state this script refuses to repair in place
#   2  present but UNPATCHED   (propagated from verify-vendor.sh)
#   3  present but an unknown revision (propagated from verify-vendor.sh)

# --- prerequisites -------------------------------------------------------------
# The patch series is ordered and every entry is required. 0001 makes a CLT-only
# build possible at all (it moves Shaders.metal off the offline `metal` compiler);
# 0002 fixes SwiftTerm #494; 0003 fixes the alt-buffer bleed; 0004 stops an
# ungated upstream debug assertion from calling abort() in RELEASE on every
# resize; 0005 adds DCS Ptmux passthrough so tmux can forward SGR sequences; 0006
# gates linefeed's selection.selectNone() on terminal.mouseMode != .off so a plain
# shell prompt keeps the user's selection while output streams. A tree missing any
# one of them is not the tree this project is tested against, which is the whole
# reason the pin records hashes rather than a version.
