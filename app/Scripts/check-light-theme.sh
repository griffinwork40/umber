#!/bin/bash
#
# check-light-theme.sh — the shipped palettes are well-formed, and `afk-light` is
# actually light enough to flip the window chrome.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/ThemeValues.swift` only. That file is
# Foundation-only BY DESIGN — its header says so — precisely so it can be compiled on
# its own with swiftc and never link AppKit or SwiftTerm. Same trick
# check-renderer-config.sh plays on Renderer.swift and check-cursor-style.sh plays on
# CursorStyle.swift. Compiling the SHIPPED file, not a copy of its values, is the whole
# point: a check that restates the palette proves only that the check agrees with itself.
#
# `Theme.swift` is deliberately NOT the subject and cannot be: it imports AppKit *and*
# SwiftTerm, so `swiftc Sources/Umber/Theme.swift` exits 1 on `no such module 'SwiftTerm'`
# and nothing in it has ever been gateable. That is why the palettes and the luminance
# formula were moved out — the split is what created something checkable.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. `AppConfig.appearance` (`Config.swift:149`) derives the window's
# light/dark chrome from the theme background's relative luminance:
#
#     NSAppearance(named: Double(effectiveBackground.relativeLuminance) > WCAG.lightChromeCutoff
#                        ? .aqua : .darkAqua)
#
# So a "light" preset whose background lands at or below that cutoff installs its
# colours and leaves the sidebar, titlebar and scrollers DARK. The result is a config
# line that parses, warns about nothing, and half-works — the quietest possible failure
# and exactly the class check-renderer-config.sh exists to prevent for `renderer`.
# Nothing else in this repo can catch it, because the deciding comparison lives in a
# file that imports AppKit. Case 2 below is that assertion, and it is why this script
# exists; the other six are there to stop case 2 passing for the wrong reason.
#
# `lightChromeCutoff` itself is declared in `ThemeValues.swift`, the file THIS script
# compiles, and `Config.swift:149` reads that exact symbol rather than a second literal —
# there used to be two independent `0.179`s, one production read and one this gate read,
# and nothing tied them together (PR #24 review, item 1). Cases 2–3 below now constrain
# the same constant `AppConfig.appearance` compares against.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, stated plainly the way check-cwd-follow.sh states its blindness:
# it never renders a pixel. It cannot tell you the sidebar's vibrant material actually
# changed, that the tab strip picked the right rail blend, that the caret is visible
# inside a selection, or that `.aqua` chrome looks right against #FFFFFF. Those import
# AppKit and are UMBER_DIAG and daily-drive territory. It also says nothing about ANSI
# 16-255: Umber pins `ansi256PaletteStrategy = .xterm` (`TerminalPane.swift:165`) so
# those 240 indices are the emulator's fixed xterm cube, not ours — and being dark-tuned,
# many of them are low-contrast on a white background. That is a known, documented
# limitation (app/README.md), not something this gate can measure or fix.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/check-light-theme.sh            # run all cases
#   ./Scripts/check-light-theme.sh --quiet    # summary line and failures only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every palette is well-formed, afk-light flips the chrome, the dark ones do not,
#      and every content slot is legible on its own background
#   1  a real failure — a malformed palette, a light theme that would render dark
#      chrome, a broken luminance formula, or an illegible slot
#   2  environmental — no swiftc, source file missing, or a harness that would not
#      compile. Never conflated with 1: a broken environment must not read as a green
#      gate.
