# Assert that a `cursor` string in config.json maps to the caret it names, that an
# unrecognised one maps to NOTHING so AppConfig.load() can warn and degrade, and that every
# case still emits the DECSCUSR code it emitted before the enum moved.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `Sources/Umber/CursorStyle.swift` only. Foundation-only by design — its
# header says so — so it compiles standalone with swiftc and never links AppKit, SwiftTerm or
# libghostty. Same trick check-renderer-config.sh plays on Renderer.swift, check-keybindings.sh
# on KeyBindings.swift, check-cwd-follow.sh on ShellDirectory.swift. Compiling the SHIPPED
# file, not a copy, is the whole point: a check that restates the table proves only that the
# check agrees with itself.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. On 2026-07-31 `CursorStyle` stopped being **SwiftTerm's** enum and became this
# project's own, so that a second engine-backed pane could read `AppConfig.cursorStyle` without
# importing the emulator (and so deleting SwiftTerm at Step 2 of the libghostty swap would not
# break Config.swift). That move carried two hand-maintained tables across a file boundary —
# the six config spellings and the six DECSCUSR codes — and a transcription slip in either is
# the quietest possible bug: a config line that reads correctly, parses without a warning, and
# either does nothing or silently selects a different caret. Nothing else in the repo would
# catch it. TerminalPane feeds `\e[<n> q` straight to the emulator, so a wrong `n` is a wrong
# cursor with no error anywhere, and `check-keybindings.sh` does not touch this file.
#
# THE CODES ARE ASSERTED AGAINST THE PRE-MOVE SOURCE, NOT AGAINST THE NEW ENUM. The six
# expected values below are transcribed from the switch as it stood in TerminalPane.swift
# BEFORE the refactor (blinkBlock=1 … steadyBar=6). That is what makes this a regression test
# rather than a tautology: if the move mistyped a code, this fails even though the new file is
# internally consistent.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/check-cursor-style.sh            # run all cases
#   ./Scripts/check-cursor-style.sh --quiet    # summary line and failures only
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every spelling maps as promised, unknowns are rejected, every DECSCUSR code is unchanged
#   1  a real failure — a spelling, a code, the decomposition, or the default is wrong
#   2  environmental — no swiftc, source file missing, or a harness that would not compile.
#      Never conflated with 1: a broken environment must not read as a green gate.
