# Third-party licenses

Umber itself is MIT — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). This file covers everything Umber
**redistributes**: the code compiled into the shipping binary, and the colour palettes
transcribed into its source.

Everything here is MIT. There is no copyleft anywhere in the graph, and the one
Apache-2.0 package SwiftPM resolves is not linked — see "Resolved but not shipped" below,
which shows the work rather than asserting the conclusion.

## Compiled into the Umber binary

| Component | Version | License | Copyright |
|---|---|---|---|
| [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm) | v1.15.0 + 4 local patches | MIT | Miguel de Icaza; the xterm.js authors; SourceLair; Christopher Jeffrey |
| [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) (`libghostty`) | `35e1a01` via libghostty-spm 1.3.2 | MIT | Mitchell Hashimoto, Ghostty contributors |
| [libghostty-spm](https://github.com/Lakr233/libghostty-spm) | 1.3.2 | MIT | @Lakr233 |
| [MSDisplayLink](https://github.com/Lakr233/MSDisplayLink) | 2.1.0 | MIT | Lakr Aream |

Both terminal engines are linked on purpose while the libghostty probe runs — see
`AFK.md` ("the libghostty probe") and `app/Package.swift`. When one is deleted, delete
its entry here too.

### SwiftTerm

Vendored at `vendor/SwiftTerm` (gitignored; materialise it with
`app/Scripts/bootstrap-vendor.sh`). Umber applies **four local patches** from
`patches/swiftterm/`, which are modifications to the original work: three fix upstream
defects (scrollback corruption on narrowing, an alt-buffer resize bleed, and an ungated
release-build `abort()`), one repackages the Metal shader as a copy resource. The patches
are themselves MIT under this notice, and each carries its rationale in `SwiftTerm.pin`.

### Ghostty

Reaches the binary as compiled object code inside `GhosttyKit.xcframework`, the prebuilt
binary target that libghostty-spm wraps. The exact upstream revision is recorded in that
package's `Ghostty.ref` (`35e1a0160c4f6797e1bb1ef8e7a2b8c6b114ab58`).

## Resolved but not shipped

Two packages appear in dependency metadata without reaching the binary. Both are listed
here so that a reader who finds them in `Package.resolved` or a checkout directory can see
they were considered rather than missed.

**[swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) 1.8.2 —
Apache-2.0 with the Swift Runtime Library Exception.** This is the only non-MIT package
SwiftPM resolves, so it is the one worth being sure about. It is pulled in by the
*vendored SwiftTerm's* own `Package.swift`, where its only consumer is `Termcast`, an
example CLI target inside that package. Umber's executable target depends on exactly
`SwiftTerm` and `GhosttyTerminal` (`app/Package.swift`), and the `SwiftTerm` **library**
target declares no dependencies of its own.

Verified against the built product rather than inferred from the manifest:

```
$ nm -a app/build/Umber.app/Contents/MacOS/Umber | grep -ci ArgumentParser
0
$ nm -a app/build/Umber.app/Contents/MacOS/Umber | grep -ci SwiftTerm
24249
```

The second number is the control: it is what makes the first one mean "absent" rather than
"the grep is broken". No `NOTICE` file exists in the package, so Apache-2.0 §4(d) — whose
trigger is conditional on one existing — never fires either way.

**iTerm2-Color-Schemes (Mark Badolato, MIT)**, 485 colour schemes bundled inside
libghostty-spm's `GhosttyTheme` module. Umber imports no part of `GhosttyTheme`, and the
module is not a dependency of the `GhosttyTerminal` product Umber does import.

---

## Colour palettes

Not code, but transcribed values, and three of the five came from somewhere. The source
comments in `app/Sources/Umber/ThemeValues.swift` describe each palette's provenance; this
is where the licences for that provenance live.

| Preset | Origin | License |
|---|---|---|
| `umber` | Designed for this app — derived and measured in `.afk/research/theme-design-2026-08-03/`. No external source. | — (this project) |
| `afk-light` | A verbatim port of **GitHub's Light Default**, whose colour primitives are published in [primer/primitives](https://github.com/primer/primitives). | MIT |
| `afk-dark` | A 1:1 port of the `terminal` block of `afk-dark.terax-theme` in the [agent-afk](https://github.com/griffinwork40/agent-afk) repo — a GitHub-Dark skeleton with that project's warm-orange accent. | MIT |
| `tokyo-night` | Transcribed verbatim from [enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme). | MIT |
| `classic-repaired` | macOS Terminal.app "Basic" as SwiftTerm encodes it (`Color.terminalAppColors`), with two measured defects repaired. | MIT (SwiftTerm, above) |

`classic` installs no palette at all, so it attributes nothing.

## Re-deriving this list

```sh
cat vendor/SwiftTerm/LICENSE                          # after ./app/Scripts/bootstrap-vendor.sh
cat app/.build/checkouts/*/LICENSE*                   # after swift build
cat app/.build/checkouts/libghostty-spm/Ghostty.ref   # the pinned Ghostty revision
nm -a app/build/Umber.app/Contents/MacOS/Umber | grep -ci <symbol>
```

If a dependency is added, removed, or bumped, update this file in the same commit — a
notices file that lags the manifest is worse than none, because it reads as verified.
